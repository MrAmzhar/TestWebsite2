<h3>2 Harsh Conditions :</h3>


<p>Sandy surroundings</p>
<p>Saline waters(waters that have low levels of oxygen)</p>


<h3>How the organism adapts to the harsh conditions of the habitat ?</h3>


<p> 1.Mangrove Horseshoe crabs have five pairs of legs. 4 pairs are used for walking and the 5th pair is to keep them from getting stuck in the sand. 
This pair of legs has a flap that spreads out to distribute the pressure from the weight of the horseshoe crab evenly and 
allowing it to walk on top of the sand easily. 
</p>

<p> 2.Mangrove horseshoe crabs can tolerate a wide range of oxygen levels as physiological adaptations in the blood enables them to 
survive hypoxic condition when spending winter on the continental shelf or when partially buried during spawning. 
These adaptations allows mangrove horseshoe crabs to cope with periods of oceanic deoxygenation .</p>
