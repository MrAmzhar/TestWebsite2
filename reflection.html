<h1>Reflection</h1>

<p>1.My initial impression of Singapore’s biodiversity 
was that there were only around a hundred organisms in Singapore as Singapore was known to be a very small country - ' the red dot' .
However, after visiting the museum, I was shocked ! There were so many display cases of different types of organisms. I saw insects as big as my hand 
and as small as my pinky . It was really an eye-opener. I never knew there were crabs as huge as half my body size, as 
I have only seen crabs served in restaurants that were more common. In a nutshell, after visiting the museum, I realised that the number of 
organisms I know is actually only a percent of the many different organisms in Singapore.

<p>2.Some challenges faced by the conservationists are the lack of funds, having no support from the government and incorporative 
public etc. Without  funds, the conservationists may not have enough money to travel to their research place or buy equipments. 
The support from the government is also important. With the support from the government, conservationists will be able to 
do things that may have been restricted to them. If the public do not take care of the nature, and continue to throw rubbish 
and smoke it will affect the environment and nature.</p

<P>3.Global warming is one key human threat that exist in our biodiversity. The one lesser of a threat is hunting. Whereas, the burning of 
trees , causing the destruction of habitats is a major threat. </p>

<p>4.The 'Position Paper on Lentor (Tagore) Forest' is a recent example of local nature conservation effort that happened in April 2016. </p>
<p>5.My peers and I can raise public awareness
 by spreading the message to our friends and family or even do simple things like picking up rubbish on the beach 
to prevent sea creatures from getting tangled or stuck in it. </p>
